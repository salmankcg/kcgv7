              Nicolai Gheorghiev, System AWS Administrator at Kingâ€™s Crest Global, has always had an unmistakable passion for navigating systems, which began with his dream of one day becoming a pilot. He studied engineering in the Republic of Moldova and chose to specialize in Management of Radio and Electronics, which piqued his interest in technology, and provided a segue into learning more about the vast world of computing technologies. Eventually, he discovered his career path as a system administrator, which he felt was similar to being a pilot in how you navigate through the entire operating system. What distinguishes him is his empathetic nature, his keen ability to problem solve, and the fact that he is a change-driven professional. He is a person who is willing to take on the challenge no matter how ambitious it may be.
